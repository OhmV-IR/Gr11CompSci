# L1.1A Printing
# REDACTED(I <3 not doxxing myself)
# A program that prints 3 lines, 2nd line is the result of 2 + 3 and third line is the square root of 25

#Print Hi there! on the first line
print("Hi there!")
# Print This is another line 5 on another line because the print function automatically starts a new line and does the calculation of 2+3
print("This", "is", "another", "line", 2+3) # strings have been glued together!
# Print The square root of 25 is 5 on a new line because python prints the integer and does the square root calculation. Python adds a new line for every print statement
print("The square root of", 25, "is", 25**0.5) # exponentiation using **, 0.5 means to perform the square root operation(0.5 is the reciprocal of 2)

#test cases
"""
Hi there!
This is another line 5
The square root of 25 is 5
